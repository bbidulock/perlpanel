INSTALL
=======

PerlPanel comes with a Makefile. To install it, simply do the following:

	$ make
	$ su
	Enter password:
	# make install

By default, PerlPanel installs into /usr. To change that, look for this line
in Makefile:

	PREFIX=/usr

And change it to something else.

To uninstall PerlPanel, simply run 'make uninstall' as root.
