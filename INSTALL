INSTALL
=======

What you will need is this:

    * Perl 5.8.0 or higher (5.8.3 recommended)
    * Gtk+ version 2.4.0 or higher
    * libglade
    * The XML::Simple Perl module
    * The XML::Parser Perl module
    * The Date::Manip Perl module
    * The following libraries from Gtk2-Perl:
      - Glib
      - Gtk2
      - Gtk2::GladeXML
      - Gtk2::TrayManager
      - Gnome2::Wnck
      - Gnome2::VFS
    * The X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry module

Some of the applets also require additional modules, for example:

    * URI::Escape for the RecentFiles applet
    * Xmms::Remote for the XMMS applet
    * Audio::Mixer for the Volume applet

Your Perl package should include the following modules, but if it's an
older version you may need to install them yourself:

    * Digest::MD5
    * File::Basename
    * Locale::gettext

Perl and Gtk+ should have been installed with your operating system. If
you don't have Gtk+ 2 or higher, then you might want to try a Gnome
distribution such as Ximian Desktop or Dropline. Alternatively you can
download source code from http://www.gtk.org/.

The XML::Simple is available on CPAN. The Gtk2-Perl libraries can be
found on the Sourceforge page at

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk2-perl.

Gnome2::Wnck is the Perl binding for libwnck, the Window Navigation
Construction Kit. Gnome2::VFS is the Perl binding for the GNOME VFS
system. You do not need a full GNOME distribution in order to use
these modules - they have the Gnome2:: prefix because they're
maintained by the GNOME developers.

Note about XML::Simple
======================

By default, XML::Simple will attempt to use XML::SAX as an XML parser.
However we have observed that in some situations this can result in
unreliable conversion of data. So PerlPanel forces the use of
XML::Parser instead of XML::SAX. So even if you have XML::Simple
installed you may find that PerlPanel won't run - this is because
XML::Parser is required.

Installing PerlPanel
====================

Installing PerlPanel is a simple matter of downloading the source
tarball, extracting it, and then running the following commands:

        [user@host]$ make
        [user@host]$ su
        Enter password:
        [root@host]# make install

By default, PerlPanel will install into the /usr/local directory. If you
want to change this, you can either edit the PREFIX variable in the
Makefile, or add 'PREFIX=/path/to/directory' as an argument to make:

	[user@host]$ make PREFIX=/opt/perlpanel
	[user@host]$ su
	Enter password:
	[root@host]# make install PREFIX=/opt/perlpanel

PerlPanel Packages
==================

PerlPanel is also available in pre-built packages for a number of
operating systems.

RPM: These packages should work on any operating system that supports
the RPM system, for example Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake and SuSE. Simply
download the NoArch RPM and run:

        [root@host]# rpm -Uvh PerlPanel-x.y.z-1.noarch.rpm

If you want to build your own RPMs from the source RPM, simply download
the PerlPanel-x.y.x.src.rpm file and run these commands:

        [root@host]# rpm -ivh PerlPanel-x.y.z.src.rpm
        [root@host]# cd /path/to/rpm/directory/SPECS
        [root@host]# rpmbuild -bb PerlPanel-x.y.z.spec --target=noarch
        [root@host]# rpm -Uvh ../RPMS/noarch/PerlPanel-x.y.z-1.noarch.rpm

You can also build an RPM directly from the source tarball, using

        [root@host]# rpmbuild -tb PerlPanel-x.y.z.tar.gz

Debian: Users of Debian GNU/Linux or its derivatives can install
PerlPanel by running the command

	apt-get install perlpanel

Gentoo: Users of the Gentoo operating system can find ebuilds via the
project website.
