README-IL8N
===========

PerlPanel uses gettext to provide support for foreign languages. If you
would like to translate PerlPanel into your own language, you must copy
the file src/po/en.po to src/po/YOUR_LANGUAGE.po and begin to translate
the strings found inside.

When you submit your translation for inclusion into the main
distribution, please check to make sure that the patch you submit is of
the correct character set, namely UTF-8.

I recommend gtranslator (http://gtranslator.sf.net/) for a nice GUI .po
file editor.
