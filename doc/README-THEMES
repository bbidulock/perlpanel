README-THEMES
=============

PerlPanel now supports the Freedesktop.org icon theme specification. Previously,
PerlPanel's icons were installed in $PREFIX/share/pixmaps/perlpanel, now they're
in $PREFIX/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps. Therefore, if an icon theme includes
icon files that PerlPanel is looking for, they will be automatically picked up.

Naming conventions
==================

PerlPanel's icons are named thus:

	1. Applets - an applet's icon has the form:

		perlpanel-applet-[appletname].png

	   where [appletname] is the name of the applet in lower case.

	2. Actions - action icons (eg reboot, shutdown) have the form:

		perlpanel-action-[action].png

	3. Configurator icons - there are currently two icons in the
	   Configuration dialog that can be themed (the others are take from the
	   Applet). These icons are named:

		perlpanel-applets.png
		perlpanel-panel.png

	4. Main program icon - the main program icon is named perlpanel.png.

	5. Applet category icons - applet category icons have names of the form

		perlpanel-applets-[category].png

	   The current categories are: actions, system, utilities, launchers and
	   menus.
