ChangeLog
=========

YYYY-MM-DD - v0.9.1
	* This release properly fixes the panel border by using low-level
	  drawing functions. New applets include: Timer, Trash, Volume. A
	  number of other applets have been given a spring clean. You can
	  drag launchers from the GNOME Menu (although not yet onto the
	  panel). The .desktop file library has been split into a separate
	  package called X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry, which is available
	  from CPAN, and the .desktop editor program has been overhauled to
	  use it. The BatteryMonitor applet does ACP/APM detection. You can
	  now upload your SSH key to remote hosts with the ShellManager
	  applet.

2004-12-10 - v0.9.0
	* This release adds proper calendaring functions to the Clock applet -
	  you can add events to your calendar for a particular date, and
	  get reminders for them. A new command-line tool is available to
	  install applets, so that third-party applets can be packaged as RPMs
	  or DEBs. A new DriveManager applet makes it easy to mount, unmount
	  and eject removable media devices. You now can specify the panel size
	  in pixels instead of named sizes, and the panel can be set not to
	  "expand", and instead will be centered on the window edge. Unicode
	  support has been improved for .desktop files, and translated strings
	  are used in the GNOME menu when available. You can drag and drop
	  launcher icons to and from the panel. And there have been a large
	  number of bug fixes and optimisations.

2004-09-29 - v0.8.0

	* This release introduces some massive changes to PerlPanel. First off
	  is the eagerly awaited Notification Area applet, which exists only
	  because of the altruism of Christian Borup. Then there's the new
	  applet install system, which lets users download and install applets
	  in a few clicks. A number of applets have been improved on: the
	  WiFiMonitor applet supports more interface names; the Pager now
	  has a context menu; the calendar has been restored to the Clock
	  applet; the CPUTemp applet now works with the CPU temperature monitor
	  on Dell systems; the WindowMenu applet now tracks the currently
	  active window. All applets which use .desktop files (GnomeMenu,
	  IconBar and Launcher) now support launch feedback, and you can
	  active launch feedback on the Launcher and IconBar applets through
	  the .desktop editor. A lot of work has been done to improve
	  responsiveness and startup time.

2004-08-25 - v0.7.0

	* This release includes two new icon themes - Bluecurve and crystalsvg.
	  The main development work has focused on implementing support for
	  applets with multiple instances - so you can have to mailbox
	  monitoring applets, each monitoring a different mailbox. There's a
	  new "Launcher" applet which uses this.

2004-07-07 - v0.6.0

	* PerlPanel now supports icon themes, so icon themers can create icons
	  for their themes that PerlPanel will pick up. Auto-completion has
	  been added to the Commander and RunMe applets. A new Wireless signal
	  strength applet has been added. The panel itself now has a border that
	  doesn't break Fitt's Law. The 'Add To Applet' submenu has been broken
	  down into categories to make it easier to use. The 'Lock Screen' applet
	  and action item will be greyed out if xscreensaver isn't running. When
	  an applet fails to load, the error message will be more informative. And
	  a large number of bugs have been fixed.

2004-05-30 - v0.5.0

	* This release fixes a large number of bugs and introduces changes that
	  simplify the interface. Several new applets have been introduced: a
	  "Recent Files" Freedesktop.org standard applet, a CPU temperature
	  applet that requires the mbmon program, and a very experimental
	  applet that displays your OpenBox menu. The IconBar applet is more
	  compliant with Fitt's Law, and the "run program" history is now
	  shared between the Commander and RunMe applets. Right-clicking on
	  a spacer now brings up an action menu.

2004-05-28 - v0.4.2

	* This release introduces a handful of new applets: A Gnome menu,
	  an SSH shell manager, a SETI@Home monitor, and a "mini-commander".
	  This release requires Gtk+ 2.4.0.

2004-04-06 - v0.4.1

	* This release focuses on the implementation of support for GNU
	  gettext. Users are encouraged to submit a translation of
	  PerlPanel's strings into their own languages. To comply with
	  Fitt's Law, the shadow border around the panel has been
	  removed, but can be reinstated with a hidden preference.
	  "Power Off" and "Reboot" options have been added to the
	  default actions. A "Screenshot" applet, with a corresponding
	  action menu item, has been added.

2004-02-20 - v0.4.0

	* The Configuration applet has been rewritten using Glade for
	  improved maintainability. The applet API has been
	  substantially cleaned up, and new functionality has been
	  added. The documentation has been expanded to include manual
	  pages for PerlPanel's supporting programs. The build system has
	  been overhauled, to comply with Debian's packaging policies.
	  You can now change the geometry of the Pager applet.

2004-02-02 - v0.3.1

	* This release includes a new "action menu" applet, for which a
	  base menu class has been implemented. The Commander dialog has
	  been improved, and can now be called from an external program.
	  The handling of icons has been made more consistent to make it
	  easier to implement icon themes in the future. A load of bugs
	  have been fixed.

2004-01-17 - v0.3.0

	* This release supports EWMH struts, so maximizing windows
	  doesn't obscure the panel. You can now reorder icons on the
	  IconBar. The Applet selector has been beautified, with icons
	  for each applet. The XMMS applet has been almost completely
	  rewritten, and now includes a volume control. Popup menus now
	  appear correctly aligned with the applets. The BBMenu applet
	  has been substantially rewritten, allowing for custom icons.
	  A new WindowMenu applet gives you access to all the open
	  windows without using up space.

2004-01-06 - v0.2.0

	* The interaction with the icon editor is much more efficient.
	  The menu button's click behavior is more user-friendly. The
	  config file version mismatch test has been disabled. The menu
	  applet will attempt to locate an icon for application
	  entries. The Separator applet has been given some spacing on
	  each side to make it more visible. Two new applets have been
	  introduced: a "Flexible spacer" applet and a "Slot" applet
	  which supports the XEMBED extension, allowing non-PerlPanel
	  programs to attach to the panel. The old PanelPet applet has
	  been restored. Source and noarch RPMs are now available.

2003-12-23 - v0.1.1

	* This release fixes a lot of bugs with the panel itself and
	  with many of the applets. It also introduces a configurable
	  label for the menu button. There is also a new Nautilus
	  bookmarks applet.

2003-10-12 - v0.1.0

	* This release includes Tasklist, Workspace Pager, and "Show
	  Desktop" applets using the libwnck Perl bindings. You can now
	  run multiple panels by specifying an alternate configuration
	  file.

2003-07-21 - v0.0.5

	* This release is compatible with the recent 0.90 release of
	  Gtk2-Perl. A couple of new applets have been included. The
	  configurator includes some options for the menu. The applet
	  interface and documentation have been revised.

2003-06-27 - v0.0.4

	* This is the first beta quality release. A calendar widget has
	  been added to the clock dialog. PerlPanel will now take screen
	  dimensions from the xdpyinfo program when GdkScreen is not
	  available. The menu applet has a new icon. Drag and drop has
	  been implemented in the Applet configuration tab.

2003-06-23 - v0.0.3

	* This release includes a huge number of improvements. The Menu
	  applet has been rewritten and loads much more quickly. A new
	  CPU load applet has been added. The applet interface has been
	  cleaned up and extended. Manual pages for the program and a
	  HOWTO for applet developers have been added. A Gtk-only
	  .desktop file editor has been created. PerlPanel will take
	  screen dimensions directly from Gdk where available. Icons are
	  resized at the GdkPixbuf level, removing the need for the
	  Image::Size module and a cache on disk. Icons also have a
	  context menu.

2003-06-10 - v0.0.2

	* This release introduces a large number of improvements,
	  including a Makefile for installation, a GUI configuration
	  dialog, a working menu applet that uses your
	  Blackbox/Fluxbox/OpenBox/Waimea menu, and context menus on
	  icons. Icons are dynamically rescaled using GdkPixbuf instead
	  of being cached on disk.

2003-06-02 - v0.0.1

	* Initial release.
